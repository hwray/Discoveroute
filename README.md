Discoveroute
============

##Search for convenient places to stop along a route you need to travel.

###Mobile mapping applications have made it easy to do two things, separately: 

####* Get from point A to point B
####* Find and compare local businesses to fill a need: food, drink, or entertainment

###But users often have to solve both these problems together: 

####* Get from point A to point B, and make a convenient stop along the way for coffee, lunch, or shopping
