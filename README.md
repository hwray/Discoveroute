Discoveroute
============

##Search for convenient places to stop along a route. 

####Mobile mapping apps have made it easy to do two things, separately: 

* Get from point A to point B
* Find and compare local businesses to fill a need: food, drink, or entertainment

####But users often have to solve both these problems together: 

* Get from point A to point B, and make a convenient stop at a business along the way (for lunch, coffee, shopping, etc.) 

###Discoveroute helps users by providing time- and space-constrainted local business search. 

####Example use case: 

* It's the morning of your first day at a new job. You'd like to find a convenient place to stop for coffee on the way in.
