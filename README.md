Discoveroute
============

##Search for convenient places to stop along a route. 

###Mobile mapping apps have made it easy to do two things, separately: 

####* Get from point A to point B
####* Find and compare local businesses to fill a need: food, drink, or entertainment

###But users often have to solve both these problems together: 

####* Get from point A to point B, and make a convenient stop at a business along the way (for lunch, coffee, shopping, etc.) 

###Discoveroute helps users in these scenarios by providing time- and space-constrainted local business search.
